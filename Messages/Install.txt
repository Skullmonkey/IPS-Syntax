Thank you for choosing to use the IPS Syntax highlighter and autocompleter.

This plugin simply expands on the HTML syntax to add IPS functions and code snippets. It was created to increase efficiency while coding for IPS products. instead of typing out a full function, all you have to do is type a few letters and press tab.

Ex: instead of typing 
<if test="this == that">
  Do this
</if>

You only have to type

if(tab)this == that(tab)Do this(tab)

and your done! The output will be the exact same as above!
